# What is the difference between `SRT subtitles and VTT`?

    SRT files are plain text files, which means they do not contain any metadata. 
    VTT files do contain metadata, as well as information about formatting the captions. 

    For instance, with VTT files, the user can adjust the color, 
    font and placement of their captions.
